OneRoster Extension Specification Diff Document
This diff document highlights the additional capabilities and metadata-driven enhancements we are layering onto OneRoster v1.2 Services—introducing new functionality, routes, and data handling approaches—while preserving the integrity and interoperability of the original specification.

Service-Specific Endpoint Extensions
Rostering Service
The current OneRoster v1.2 spec for the Rostering Service provides the GET method for its defined endpoints. We will layer on top POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. 

OneRoster versions 1.1 and 1.2 handle object deletion differently. Version 1.2 introduced the requirement that objects flagged for deletion must be labeled as 'tobedeleted' else they are ‘active’. Systems can delete 'tobedeleted' records as needed, with no obligation to do so. Objects marked 'inactive' in version 1.1 should be treated as 'tobedeleted' for compatibility. We will implement v1.2 soft delete for all DELETE methods.
